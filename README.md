# UW Coding Bootcamp Refactoring Project
## February 23, 2022

This is a UW Coding Bootcamp project that requires students to refactor existing html and CSS code belonging to a mock website of a fictional business.  I, Kevin Cole, completed this project February 23, 2022.

## Description

In this project, I refactored source code of a ficitional website to improve the code in terms of semantics, structure, readbability, simplicity, function, and accessibility, without changing the appearance of the website.

My motivation and reason for doing this project was to learn how to refactor, and to become more familiar with html and CSS, including semantic html.

Before I started this project, there was a significant lack of semantic html in the website's source code, plus poor structure and use of selectors in the CSS code.  I feel I was able to make a good number of changes to the html that will help make it and the website, and the information the website contains about Horiseon's business, more accessible to web browsers and users, including, I hope, users who are vision impaired.  As for the CSS code, I feel I improved the flow of it and simplified it by re-organizing it into a cascade, "top to bottom" structure, and by consolidating multiple CSS rules into fewer rules, and by replacing unnecessary and sometimes confusing CSS selectors with simple, direct semantic html tags.  I attempted to provide helpful comments to explain changes I made to both the html and CSS code.

By doing this project, I learned what refactoring is and how to do it.  I also learned a good deal about html and CSS, semantic html and accessibility, and coding in general.
