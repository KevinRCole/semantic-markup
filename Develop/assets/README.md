# Name of Project:

Semantic-Markup

## Description of Project:

Refactoring of HTML and CSS code of mock website of fictional company named Horiseon.

## Motivation fo the project:

My motivation for this project was to learn about refactoring by actually doing it myself.

## Why I worked on this project:

I worked on this project because I want to learn as much about coding as I can, and refactoring is a critical part of coding.

## What I accomplished:

I was able to refactor a mock website by (1) rewriting and simplyifing parts of the underlying code, in both HTML and CSS, and providing exaplanatory comments for persons, including me, who may work to improve the code in the future; (2) by restructuring the code to improve the "top to bottom: order or "cascadng" flow of the commands;(3) by adding semantic HTML tags to improve the accessibility of the website to web browers and users, includng users who may be vision impaired; (4) identifying and correcting a but in the code.  Consistent with the principles of refactoring, I attempted preserve the external output and appearance of the website while making these internal changes to the code.  The website now does a better job conveying informaiton to web browsers and users.

## What I learned:

I learned that coding is complex, challenging, frustrating, and rewarding. It's especially rewarding if you have a particular goal in mind when you start a coding project, and the goal involves helping someone else accomplish something worthwile, and you are able to make progress towards accomplishing that goal.
